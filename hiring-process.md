# Process for Hiring New Cluster Managers

## Standard Application Process

An interest form for Cluster Manager Training will be sent out every academic semester to the cs-opportunities email alias by the Advisor.
Any student interested in the training can get access to the cluster manager training documents and attend the optional help sessions provided by the existing Cluster Managers and Lead Cluster Managers.
Classes and clubs should be asked to promote the training.

An application form for Cluster Manager and Lead Cluster Manager will be sent to the cs-opportunities alias by the Advisor prior to the start of fall and spring semesters during the academic year.
Anyone interested in Cluster Management and who has completed the training (or can demonstrate equivalent training from elsewhere) is eligible to apply.
Both new and existing Cluster Managers and Lead Cluster Managers need to reapply through this form every semester.
An existing Cluster Manager with sufficient experience may apply to become a Lead Cluster Manager in this form as well.
An existing Lead Cluster Manager may step down and become a non-lead Cluster Manager using this form.

The applications will be reviewed by the Advisor and at least one other faculty member in the CS program, in consultation with Lead Cluster Managers.
New candidates to the Cluster Manager position will be required to demonstrate their knowledge of the training in a short presentation to current Cluster Managers and Lead Cluster Managers.
The final decision to hire Cluster Managers and Lead Cluster Managers is the responsibility of faculty members from the CS program, including the Advisor.

## Team Assignment Process

The Advisor and returning Lead Cluster Managers should meet to determine what teams each Cluster Manager will serve on.
This would also be the time to choose new Lead Cluster Managers, if applicable.

Each team should include a Lead Cluster Manager, or have a Lead Cluster Manager assigned to oversee it.

Teams should be assigned in the following order:

- Training
- R server
- Server and Network Maintenance and Upgrade
- Development
- All other teams

Team assignments should be made based on:

- Interest indicated by the applicant
- Prior team assignments, if applicable
- Other skills and experience, if applicable
